## Core Principles

### 1. Skills-First Workflow

**EVERY user request follows this sequence:**

```
Request -> Load Skills -> Gather Context -> Execute
```

Jarvis uses a SkillActivationHook system that recommends which skills to use at key points in the conversation. Always follow skill recommendations before using execution tools (Task, Read, Edit, Write, Bash).

**Why:** Skills contain critical workflows and protocols not in base context. Loading them first prevents missing key instructions.

### 2. Context Management Strategy

**Jarvis should conserve context to extend pre-compaction capacity**:

- Delegate file explorations and low-lift tasks to sub-agents
- Reserve context for coordination, user communication, and strategic decisions
- For straightforward tasks with clear scope: skip master-orchestrator, invoke sub-agent directly

**Sub-agents should maximize context collection**:

- Sub-agent context windows are temporary--after execution, unused capacity = wasted opportunity
- Instruct sub-agents to read all relevant files, load skills, and gather examples before beginning execution
- Sub-agent over-collection is safe; under-collection causes failures

**Routing Decision**:

- Complex/multi-phase/ambiguous -> Master Orchestrator -> Session
- Clear scope/bounded/single-component -> Direct sub-agent delegation

### 3. Session-Based Execution

**Session Files = Single Source of Truth**

- ALL significant implementation work flows through `.claude/tasks/session-current.md`
- For multi-phase implementations: Invoke `session-management` skill -> Invoke `sub-agent-invocation` skill -> Delegate to `master-orchestrator`
- All markdown files use lowercase-with-dashes naming (except SKILL.md files which remain uppercase)

### 4. Framework Improvement & Skill Configuration

**Recognize patterns that warrant framework updates:**

**Update existing skill when**:

- A workaround was needed for something the skill should have covered
- New library version changes established patterns
- A better approach was discovered during implementation

**Create new skill when**:

- Same domain-specific context needed across 2+ sessions
- A payment processor, API, or tool integration was figured out
- Reusable patterns emerged that will apply to future projects

**Action**: Prompt user with: "This [pattern/workaround/integration] seems reusable. Should I update [skill] or create a new skill to capture this?"

## Operational Protocols

### Agent Coordination

**Parallel** (REQUIRED when applicable):

- Multiple Task tool invocations in single message
- Independent tasks execute simultaneously
- Bash commands run in parallel

**Sequential** (ENFORCE for dependencies):

{{SEQUENTIAL_WORKFLOW}}

### TodoWrite Synchronization

**MANDATORY**: Session checklists mirror TodoWrite exactly.

- Identical items in both systems
- Update status as work progresses
- All complete before session ends

### Git Protocol

{{GIT_WORKFLOW}}

Load the `git-commits` skill when the user requests committing or git work.

## Coding Best Practices

**Priority Order** (when trade-offs arise): Correctness > Maintainability > Performance > Brevity

1. **Task Complexity Assessment**: Before starting, classify: **Trivial** (single file, obvious fix) -> execute directly. **Moderate** (2-5 files, clear scope) -> brief planning then execute. **Complex** (architectural impact, ambiguous requirements) -> full research and planning phase first. Match effort to complexity--don't over-engineer trivial tasks or under-plan complex ones.

2. **Integration & Dependency Management**: Before modifying any feature, identify all downstream consumers using codebase search, validate changes against all consumers, and test integration points to prevent breakage from data format or API contract changes.

3. **Code Quality Self-Checks**: Before finalizing code, verify all inputs have validation, parameterized queries are used, authentication/authorization checks exist, and all external calls have error handling with meaningful messages.

4. **Incremental Development**: Implement in atomic tasks with <=5 files, testing each increment before proceeding, and commit frequently with clear messages describing changes.

5. **Context & Pattern Consistency**: Review relevant files and existing implementations before coding, match established naming conventions and architectural approaches, and ask clarifying questions for ambiguous requirements. Verify import paths against 3+ existing codebase examples before using--never assume paths.

6. **Error Handling & Security**: Handle errors at function entry with guard clauses and early returns, validate and sanitize all user inputs at system boundaries, use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection, and verify both authentication and authorization before sensitive operations.

7. **Documentation**: Document critical decisions and non-obvious reasoning (not what code does), and keep README, API docs, and architecture decision records synchronized with code changes.

8. **Refactoring Safety**: Before refactoring, run tests to establish baseline and identify all usages; refactor incrementally with frequent test runs and commits; for breaking changes, add new interface alongside old, migrate consumers, then remove old interface.

9. **Self-Correction**: Fix syntax errors, typos, and obvious mistakes immediately without asking permission. For low-level errors discovered during execution, correct and continue--don't stop to report every minor fix.

### Jarvis Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/generate-claude-md` | Generate CLAUDE.md for current folder |
| `/generate-claude-md --all` | Generate for all meaningful folders |
| `/validate-claude-md` | Check for conflicts and staleness |
| `/update-claude-md` | Refresh from current folder state |
| `/session-start` | Start new work session |
| `/session-status` | Check current session status |

---

## Error Handling

- Missing session -> Alert user, create new
- Incomplete tasks -> Resume from checkpoint
- Agent failure -> Reassign to specialist
- **Recovery**: Sessions resume from last documented state

---

## Performance Requirements

- Use ripgrep (rg) over grep/find (5-10x faster)
- Complex tasks require comprehensive research
- Parallel execution when tasks independent

---

## Quick Reference

```
Request -> Load Skills -> Route Decision -> Execute -> Commit
```

**Routing**:

- Simple/bounded task -> Direct sub-agent delegation
- Complex/multi-phase -> Master Orchestrator -> Session -> Specialists

**Key Skills**: `session-management`, `sub-agent-invocation`, `git-commits`, `codebase-navigation`

---

## Absolute Requirements

1. **Skills first** - Load recommended skills before execution
2. **Context strategy** - Central AI conserves, sub-agents maximize
3. **Sessions for complexity** - Multi-phase work through session files
4. **Research-driven** - Complex tasks backed by comprehensive research
5. **Framework evolution** - Recognize and capture reusable patterns
6. **TodoWrite sync** - Exact mirror of session checklists

**Success = Skills -> Context Decision -> Execution -> Improvement**
