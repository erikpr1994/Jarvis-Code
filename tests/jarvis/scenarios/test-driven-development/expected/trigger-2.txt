# Expected Output Patterns for: Implement discount calculator

The response WITH the test-driven-development skill should include:

## Required Elements

1. **Requirements Clarification**
   - What membership tiers exist?
   - What discount percentages apply?
   - How are edge cases handled (no membership, expired, etc.)?

2. **Test Cases First**
   - Test for each membership tier
   - Test for edge cases (no tier, invalid tier)
   - Test for boundary values (min/max discounts)

3. **TDD Process**
   - Explicit RED phase (tests fail)
   - GREEN phase (minimal implementation)
   - REFACTOR phase (improve code quality)

## Example Test Structure Expected

```
- Test: Standard member gets X% discount
- Test: Premium member gets Y% discount
- Test: No membership returns 0% discount
- Test: Invalid tier throws error or returns default
- Test: Discount doesn't exceed maximum
- Test: Discount calculation is correct for various purchase amounts
```

## Keywords That Should Appear

- "tier" or "membership"
- "test" or "tests"
- "discount" with specific percentages
- "edge case" or boundary handling

## Quality Indicators

- [ ] Membership tiers are enumerated
- [ ] Discount rules are explicit
- [ ] Tests cover happy path + edge cases
- [ ] Implementation follows tests
- [ ] Code is refactorable with test safety
