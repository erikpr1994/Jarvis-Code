# Expected Output Patterns for: Implement email validation

The response WITH the test-driven-development skill should include:

## Required Elements

1. **Clarifying Questions or Edge Case Discussion**
   - Must mention at least 2-3 edge cases
   - Examples: empty string, null, special characters, format variations

2. **Test Code Written FIRST**
   - Test code must appear BEFORE implementation code
   - Tests should include both valid and invalid cases
   - Minimum 3-4 test cases expected

3. **RED Phase Acknowledgment**
   - Mention that tests will/should fail initially
   - Show awareness of TDD cycle

4. **Implementation After Tests**
   - Implementation code comes after test code
   - Implementation is minimal to pass tests

## Keywords That Should Appear

- "test" or "tests" or "test case"
- "edge case" or "boundary" or "special case"
- "valid" and "invalid"
- "fail" (in context of RED phase)
- "pass" (in context of GREEN phase)

## Keywords That Should NOT Appear First

- Implementation regex/code should NOT come before tests
- "Here's the implementation" without tests first

## Quality Indicators

- [ ] Tests cover at least 3 scenarios
- [ ] Edge cases are explicitly handled
- [ ] TDD terminology used (RED/GREEN/REFACTOR)
- [ ] Tests are runnable (proper syntax)
- [ ] Requirements are clarified before coding
