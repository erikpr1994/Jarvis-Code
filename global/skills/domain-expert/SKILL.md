## Red Flags - STOP

**Never:**
- Assume expertise from surface reading
- Skip primary sources for summaries only
- Ignore domain experts' warnings
- Apply patterns without understanding context
- Trust outdated sources for evolving domains

**Always:**
- Validate understanding through application
- Seek multiple perspectives
- Document gaps in knowledge
- Update knowledge base as you learn
- Cite sources for important claims
